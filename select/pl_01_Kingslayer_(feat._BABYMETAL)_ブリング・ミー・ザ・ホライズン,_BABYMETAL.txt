hi
are you looking for
the other side?
feel like nothing ever seems
quite right?
are you circling the drain pipe,
getting off on pain like
you're corrupted?
i need to know
where your loyalties lie
tell me are you gonna bark
or bite?
do you really want to twist
the knife
in the belly of the monster?
get the fuck up
wake the fuck up
wipe the system
and back the fuck up.
you're a puppet
when they cut your strings of
don't come crawling back.
kingslayer
destroying castles in the sky
kingslayer
forevermore the apple of my eye
i'd sacrifice my life
to find you
angel of the blade
kingslayer
come and collect us
from the night
暗い (Cry)
この見えない世界
まだ消えない未来
ただ手に入れたい
another world
system failure
life
is encrypted
you are modified
like a virus
in a lullaby
artificial 'til the day you die
silly programme
you're corrupted!
get the fuck up
wake the fuck up
wipe the system
＆back the fuck up.
you're a puppet
when they cut your strings off
don't come crawling back
you're on your own.
さあ 時の
扉を開けて
行こうよ
(now, let's go
and open the door of time)
kings-layer
destroying castles in the sky
kingslayer
i'll fight for you until i die
kingslayer
destroying castles in the sky
kingslayer
forevermore the apple of my eye
i'd sacrifice it all
to guide you
never have to battle alone
kingslayer
come and collect us
from the night
this is your wake up call
we're going down the rabbit hole
are you ready?
i can't feel you.
is this what you want?
this is what you'll fucking get.
